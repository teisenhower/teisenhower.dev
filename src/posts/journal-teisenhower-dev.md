## The concept

I'm back to wanting to put out content again *(shocker)*. However, this time I am taking a different approach. I really enjoy this concept of keeping
a "Dev Journal" and it's something I've tinkered with in the past with mild success. The idea is these less formal journal entries will be a place
where I can still write dev content to share what I am learning, tips and tricks, act as a historical learning resource for me to refer back to, etc.
without the extra pressure of feeling this need to have a perfectly orchestrated well thought out blog post with screenshots and code snippets to
share with the world. This feels like a much lighter and honestly a more personal alternative vs always trying to put out your standard blog posts.

## Implementing

Initially I wanted these entries to live in the same repo with my this main blog site so they could use the same resources and styling but
it sounds like that may not be the best solution since I want to have this under a `journal` subdomain. Instead, it should be treated as an entirely
different project. I think moving forward I am ok with this. It gives me the opportunity to build something from scratch, which is always fun, and it
allows allows me to explore using a new service like Netlify to host this part of my site vs AWS Amplify where my main site lives.
