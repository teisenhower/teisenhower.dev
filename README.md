# teisenhower.dev

I chose to use [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) for several reasons. One simply because I wanted to learn the Gatsby framework along with [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/). Secondly, because I wanted to utilize [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for my posts and Gatsby combined with GraphQL makes working with Markdown files a breeze.

The site is currently hosted using AWS's [Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) which allows me continuously deploy my site as I push changes. I am also able to create and deploy test branches, allowing me to put my code into a production environment before committing it to my master branch.

I am also taking advantage of AWS to host my images on their [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) service. Between Gatsby and GraphQL, I am able to source these images from my S3 Bucket and process them locally in order to create optimized versions. The big winner here is the ability to serve [.webp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp) images to devices that support it.
